•	How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
  The first step in this is for the project owner to sit down with the stakeholder and ask detailed questions as to what they are looking for.  From there this will be placed into user stories.  These have one summarizing     statement and then bullet points with the specific needs.  This is helpful as it is easier to put into backlog tasks.  The tester can also use this to create pass/fail criteria for the user stories.

•	How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
  Once you have user stories, backlog tasks can be created and prioritized.  Then from there the team can hold a sprint planning session.  I would like to use one such as planning poker to involve everyone which can help them to feel more invested.  You should also end up with a more accurate plan for the sprint.  From there the developers can start working.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
  One of the most important characteristics of a good team member is communication.  This means being able to both give and take constructive feedback in a polite manner.  Timely communication is also key.  Each person needs to be strong in their position as they will be held accountable.  One of the best ways to do this is with a Kanban board whether physical or online.  This shows the team what every person is working on.  Daily stand up huddles can also be helpful to communicate what has been done, what is being done, and if there is anything impeding that progress.
